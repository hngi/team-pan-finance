        <h3 class=" container head mt-6">Overview</h3>
        <p>This Financial Tracker App is a very useful app as it has unique features that make it a must-have but before I go further in elucidating its several functions, let me talk a bit about its history.</p>
        <h3 class=" container head mt-6">History</h3>
        <p>Financial Tracker was conceptualized as a stage 3 task given to HNG6 Interns to facilitate their learning and enable them work or collaborate as a team. This 
            led interns, aspiring to both learn and make it to the end of the internship, to pull resources together and create a product: https://pan-fintrack.herokuapp.com. 
        Contributions were made from every quarter including designers, front and backenders, and also digital marketers. And what we can say is that it was such a positive surreal experience creating the app </p>
        <h3 class=" container head mt-6">HNG Internship</h3>
        <p>The HNG internship is a 3-month remote internship designed to find and develop the most talented software developers. Everyone is welcome to participate (there is no entrance exam). Anyone can log into the internship using their laptop. Each week,
            we give tasks. Those who complete them advance forward. We pay the interns weekly.The intern coders are introduced to complex programming frameworks, and get to work on real world software. The finalists are connected to the best companies
            in the tech ecosystem and get full time jobs and contracts immediately.</p>
            <h3 class=" container head mt-6">Financial Tracker App</h3>
        <p>Fintrack is an expense tracking web app tailored to suit your everyday spending habits. It takes into account your spending on a daily basis as you record them and then organizes your expense records on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis. It was created to help you understand where your money goes and track of the details as you spend money: when, what, why, & how much.We are trying to simplify spending tracking for the average person. We believe you donâ€™t need a defined budget to track your spending. We treat your spending as rolling and average amounts that give you the freedom to decide wether you're above or below your goal.
